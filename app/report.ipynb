However, this is a reasonable edge case, and the database system will handle it appropriately (usually by returning an error or NULL).\\n\\n*   **Adherence to the Question:**\\n    *   The query directly answers the question by calculating and displaying the percentage of films each actor has acted in, relative to the total number of films.\\n\\nTherefore, the generated query is well-structured, efficient, and accurately addresses the user's request.\"}\n",
